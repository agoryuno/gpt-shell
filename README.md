A super basic shell GPT prompter. The motivation for this is to avoid having to 
copy-paste between the terminal and the ChatGPT window all the time.

## Installing

To install, fill in the OPENAI_API_TOKEN value in `gpt-shell/config_tmpl.ini` and rename the file to `config.ini`.

Then run `./install.sh` to install for the current user.

## Using 

Type `gpt This is my prompt` in the shell.
